Some weights of the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53 were not used when initializing Wav2Vec2ForCTC: ['project_hid.bias', 'project_hid.weight', 'project_q.bias', 'project_q.weight', 'quantizer.codevectors', 'quantizer.weight_proj.bias', 'quantizer.weight_proj.weight', 'wav2vec2.encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.weight_g', 'wav2vec2.encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.weight_v']
- This IS expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForCTC from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing Wav2Vec2ForCTC from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of Wav2Vec2ForCTC were not initialized from the model checkpoint at facebook/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53 and are newly initialized: ['lm_head.bias', 'lm_head.weight', 'wav2vec2.encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.parametrizations.weight.original0', 'wav2vec2.encoder.pos_conv_embed.conv.parametrizations.weight.original1']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
